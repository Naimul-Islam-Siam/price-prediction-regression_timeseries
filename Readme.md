## Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers

We're going through a machine learning project where we use a time-series dataset with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

- #### Problem Definition
Predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given previous examples of how much a smilar bulldozer had been sold for?

- #### Data
We are using Blue Book for Bulldozers dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

- #### Evaluation
The goal for most of the regression problems is to minimize error. For example, our goal for this project is to build a machine learning model which minimize RMSLE(Root Mean Square Log Error).
